# Project Title: Supply Chain Performance & Trends Analysis (2015-2017)

## Overview: 

The dataset spans from 2015 to 2018, but data from 2018 has been excluded to ensure temporal consistency and avoid any bias from incomplete data. Therefore, this report focuses on sales, profit, and other key metrics from 2015 to 2017.

### Key Insights from 2016 vs. 2015

When comparing 2016 to 2015, the following trends were observed:

- Sales: Decreased by 0.3%
- Quantity: Decreased by 0.8%
- Profit: Decreased by 0.7%
- Orders: Decreased by 0.2%
- Discount Impact Profit: Increased by +0.2%
- Total Discount: Decreased by -0.3%
- Repeat Purchase Rate: Increased by +1%

=> The Discount Impact Profit is slightly higher in 2016, suggesting that discounts had a slightly more effect on profits, indicates that the company’s discounting strategy led to lower profit margins.

### Key Insights from 2017 vs. 2016

When comparing 2017 to 2016, the following trends were observed:

- Sales: Decreased by -4%
- Quantity: Decreased by -22.7%
- Profit: Decreased by -0.5%
- Orders: Increased by +4.8%
- Discount Impact Profit: Decreased by -1.9%
- Total Discount: Decreased by -4%
- Repeat Purchase Rate: Decreased by -12.4%

Despite the decrease in sales, quantity, and repeat purchase rates, profit did not change much in 2017, decreasing by only -0.5%. This is unusual since lower sales and repeat customers typically impact profits. it's weird,so let's explore more on sales and profit trend

## Analysis of 2017's Sales and Profit Trends

Upon closer inspection of sales trends, there was a significant drop in sales from October to December 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. Specifically:
- From October 2017, sales were reduced to half of 2016’s sales.
- Total quantity sold in 2017 from September to December was only 1/3 of 2016’s.
- Weekly Sales Trend (2017): From week 40 to week 53 in 2017, sales fluctuated, showing:

  Week 40: A sudden decrease.

  Week 43: A sharp peak, which was higher than any other week of all the year.

  Weeks 44-53: Sales dropped again, but remained fluctuating.

- Profit and Orders Trends: Despite the drop in sales and quantity, the total number of orders increased by around 18% each month from September to December 2017, which raises questions about what caused the increase in orders without impacting profit significantly.

Moreover, profit by customer segment remained relatively stable year-over-year, which is unusual given the other declines.

## Potential Causes for Trends in 2017:
1. Price and Discount Impact
- Product Price Trends: There were no price changes across the years.
- Discount Rates: The average discount remained relatively stable (around 0.1) across all years, with no significant impact on the discount trend.

=> Findings: Price and discount rate don’t seem to be the main factors causing these anomalies.

2. Customer Performance
- Quantity Sold per Customer Segment: All customer segments saw a decrease in quantity sold in 2017.
- Repeat Purchase Rate: From September to December 2017, the repeat purchase rate plummeted from 10% to 0.44%, with no return customers in November and December.
- Customer Segments: All segments experienced a drop in repeat purchase rate, indicating a potential issue with customer retention.

=> Possible Question: Is the company failing to retain customers? If so, why is the profit stable despite lower repeat purchases?

3. Product Performance

Sales and Quantity Trends by Product:
- Products that had high sales in 2015 and 2016 experienced a decline in 2017.
- New products were more popular in 2017, especially products like Dell laptops (computers) and web cameras (cameras).
- These new products had higher prices, but the quantity sold was lower, indicating that customers were purchasing fewer, higher-priced items.

=> Findings: In 2017, the product mix shifted toward newer, higher-priced products, which explains the lower quantity sold but potentially stable profits from these high-priced items.

## Customer Retention Strategies
It’s possible that the company focused more on acquiring new customers rather than retaining existing ones. This could explain:
- The decrease in repeat purchase rates across customer segments.
- The increase in orders in late 2017 despite lower repeat purchases.

=> Should the company focus on customer retention programs? Or is the strategy to focus on new customer acquisition, especially with the introduction of new high-priced products?

 ### Conclusion and Next Steps
- Key Insights: The company experienced a shift in product mix toward new, higher-priced items in 2017, which led to lower quantity sold but stable profit. This is complemented by increased order volume, likely due to an emphasis on new customer acquisition.
- Further Investigation Needed:

 + Customer retention programs: Explore whether the company failed to maintain repeat customers and whether focusing on customer loyalty could help stabilize sales and profit trends.

 + Market strategy shift: Investigate if the company’s strategy in 2017 shifted toward more premium, higher-priced products and what the impact of this strategy was on profit and quantity sold.
 + Operational changes: Check if there were any operational or supply chain changes that impacted the ability to fulfill orders and maintain consistent product availability in 2017.
